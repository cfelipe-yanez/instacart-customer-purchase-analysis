# Instacart Customer Purchase Analysis

## 📌 Project Description
In this project, I worked with real-world data from Instacart, an online grocery delivery platform similar to Uber Eats and DoorDash.

The dataset was originally released publicly by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition. The version used in this project is a modified subset of the original data: its size was reduced to allow faster computation, and missing values and duplicates were intentionally introduced while preserving the original data distributions.

The main objective of this project is to clean the data and prepare an analytical report that provides insights into Instacart customers’ purchasing habits. After answering each analytical question, the results are explained using short markdown summaries within the Jupyter notebook.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Key Tasks
- Data loading and initial inspection
- Handling missing values and duplicate records
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Analysis of customer purchasing behavior
- Interpretation and documentation of results using markdown cells

## 📈 Results
The analysis reveals meaningful patterns in customer purchasing habits, including order frequency, product popularity, and shopping behavior trends. These insights can support better understanding of customer behavior in online grocery platforms.

## 🚀 How to Run
Open the notebook and run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.
